# Sarah's Linux Notes

## Daily log in to SSH key to Github so that you can avoid entering passwords when editing

'ls -la' hidden files
colors per linux distro
relative vs absolute file references 
start with / if at top of dir
don't 'eject drive/media without that command
mkdir command
copy files: cp source destination
cp source . (use dot if copying to current dir)
locate something command uses index of all files
updatedb will reindex
find dir search criteria - 'find / -name whoami'
editors gedit is easy to learn or vi as it is powerful
touch?
esc, shift : then q get a vi cheat sheet
cat filename to view stands for concatenate out contents of file or less
less scroll up/down
pipe combine commands 'ls /dev/ | less' will allow slow order scroll
running programs (ls is one)
view your path:  '$ echo $PATH'..lots of stuff
'which ls' returns /bin/ls
'ls' runs without all that
'./set' where set is file in the current dir must be explicit (for security)
what is running on your computer:  'ps' command
'ps aux' programs running
'top' is like task mngr, q key to leave
'ifconfig eth0 10.10.10.10' to change ip
'dhclient eth0' for dscp
